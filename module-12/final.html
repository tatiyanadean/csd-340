                <img src="images/performing.png" alt="Tatiyana singing live" style="width: 100%">
                <p>I first sang in church, but I don't consider those performances. In my mind, my first performance was at a middle school poetry slam where I sung a "Fried Chicken" remix of T-Pain's "Shawty" (of which footage I am determined to hunt down).</p>
                <p>During my freshmen year at University of Louisville, I sung at campus event and open mics around the city, sometimes traveling out of town to compete.</p>
                <p>After Louisville, I moved to Atlanta where I performed anywhere from 1-3 times a week at various showcases, opening for artists and singing/rapping in competitions. Above is a flyer of one of my last (and favorite) performances in Atlanta before moving back to Kentucky (Fun Fact: This was my 1st paid performance).</p>

            <div class="column2"><h1>Songwriting</h1>
                <img src="images/songwriting.jpg" alt="Tatiyana's recent releases on Apple Music" style="width: 100%">
                <p>I write all of my own songs, which is something I didn't understand the value of until I learned that many singers can't say the same.</p>
                <p>Sometimes a label will require a singer to record or perform someone else's lyrics, but I am blessed to be an independent artist so I have the final and only say in what I do with my voice.</p>
                <p>Above are the songs I've written, recorded, and released on Apple Music (and other platforms) since 2020.</p>

            <div class="column3"><h1>Recording</h1>
                <img src="images/recording.JPG" alt="Tatiyana recording her home studio" style="width: 100%">
                <p>In 2021, I finally was able to invest in my own home studio equipment. An extremely huge blessing, having my own studio is allowing me to record songs without having to pay for studio time (which quickly gets expensive when being charged hourly).</p>

                <img src="images/reading.jpg" alt="Tatiyana reading Bamboozled by Jesus" style="width: 100%">
                <p>I love reading; it brings me a sense of peace and it expands how I see the world.</p>
                <p>If you desire to be in the music industry, or just to learn more about it, I'd highly suggest Donald Passman's book "Music Industry 101"The last book I read was "Cleopatra" by Margaret George.</p>
                <p>Here, I am pictured reading "Bamboozled by Jesus: How God Tricked Me Into the Life of My Dreams" by Yvonne Orji.</p>

                <img src="images/fitness.jpg" alt="Tatiyana at the top of the Pinnacles" style="width: 100%">
                <p>One of my favorite forms of working out is hiking! This picture is from a hike I went on with a group of friends in 2020. I also like doing home workouts & going to the gym.</p>

            <div class="column3"><h1>Dreaming</h1>
                <img src="images/dreaming.jpg" alt="Tatiyana sitting at a piano with her eyes closed" style="width: 100%">
                <p>I am a HUGE believer in the power of dreaming big. I think even if I didn't know it had power, I'd still dream big because I'm naturally wired that way (thankfully).</p>
                <p>This picture was taken in the practice rooms of the Univerity of Louisville's Music School. It was during a time when I began to perform more around campus, and the city, and I started to see the reality of my dreams forming.</p>
